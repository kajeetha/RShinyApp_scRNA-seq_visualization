# RShinyApp_scRNA-seq_visualization
This is an R Shiny app that allows for visualization of UMAP of scRNA sequencing data. 

scRNA seq analysis was performed using R package - Seurat. Metadata of cells such as cell type and sex is displayed in one graph and gene expression levels are overlayed in the neighbouring tab. 

scRNA-seq data and guided clustering tutorial was followed via [Seurat - Guided Clustering Tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html#setup-the-seurat-object) 

To create R Shiny app tutorial by [OscarW99](https://github.com/OscarW99/RShiny-tutorial-Single-cell-genomics-dashboard) was followed.
